# Giant Newsletter

A re-usable package which can be used in any project that requires a generic `News` app. 

This will include the basic formatting and functionality such as model creation via the admin.

## Installation

To install with the package manager, run:

    $ poetry add giant-news

You should then add `"news", "easy_thumbnails" and "filer"` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in `base.py`.
